                Cooking a perfect burger requires attention to detail and proper seasoning. Start by selecting high-quality ground beef with a good ratio of fat to lean meat. Season the meat with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings, such as garlic powder or Worcestershire sauce. Shape the meat into patties slightly larger than the size of your buns, making a slight indentation in the center to prevent puffing during cooking. Grill or pan-sear the burgers over medium-high heat until cooked to your desired level of doneness, typically 4-5 minutes per side for medium. Let rest for a few minutes before serving on toasted buns with your favorite toppings.
