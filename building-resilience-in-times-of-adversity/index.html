                Building resilience is essential for navigating life's challenges and bouncing back from adversity. Resilient individuals are better equipped to cope with stress, adapt to change, and maintain a positive outlook, even in difficult circumstances. Cultivating resilience involves developing coping skills, fostering social support networks, and maintaining a sense of purpose and optimism.
                <br>
                Community resilience relies on the collective strength and resourcefulness of its members to overcome adversity and emerge stronger together. By promoting resilience-building initiatives and providing support for those in need, communities can foster a culture of resilience that empowers individuals to thrive in the face of adversity.
